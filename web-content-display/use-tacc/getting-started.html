				<p>
					In this day and age, conducting scientific research relies on the analysis and interpretation of tremendous amounts of data. To find meaning in this sea of information, researchers must first be able to organize, store, and share their data. Once data are stored, researcher are able to leverage the advances in data analysis and computing capabilities, frequently referred to as "Big Data," to enable the systems at TACC to bring understanding and structure to these complex problems and highlight potentially interesting results in data sources too large for any team of people to explore by hand.</p>
				<p>
					Every day, researchers leverage TACC's high-speed, high-density data systems and powerful computational systems to make this possible. With more than 100 petabytes of dedicated user storage and several new systems designed specifically for data analysis and computations, TACC is a leader in the deployment and use of data intensive computing.</p>

				<p>
					Scientific research produces massive amounts of data, and the resulting datasets are of great value to researchers for years and even decades to come. These datasets are often extremely large and must be easily and quickly accessible as well as stored in a protected environment. Cloud computing provides instantaneous, secure access to computing resources. TACC's comprehensive set of cloud services are designed for researchers who need large-scale resources, but prefer a virtualized, on-demand environment â€“ allowing them to efficiently perform modeling and simulations, visualization, data analytics, and management from any location.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>
					Using supercomputers can be challenging for those without much computing experience. That's why the Advanced Computing Interfaces (ACI) group at TACC develops gateways and portals tools that make using TACC resources easier â€” enabling more scientists and engineers to make discoveries and answer important research questions.</p>
				<p>
					Gateways and portals enable researchers in a common field of science to use systems and resources through a familiar, targeted interface so they can focus on their research and not on the cyberinfrastructure behind the scenes. Gateways and portals also foster collaborations and the exchange of ideas among researchers.</p>
				<p>
					The TACC Gateways &amp; Portals group plays a very active role in <a href="https://www.xsede.org/" target="_blank">XSEDE</a>. TACC is the project lead for User Services, User Information and Interfaces, and manages the XSEDE user portal.</p>

					The proliferation and accessibility of massive online databases of textual, visual and aural resources have brought new complexity to the study of history, languages, civilizations, and human activities. More than ever before, advanced computational systems, tools and techniques are required to visualize, display, analyze, manage and preserve digital resources.</p>
				<p>
					TACC staff collaborate with researchers from colleges at the University of Texas at Austin â€“ including the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, Communications, Architecture, Social work, McCombs School of Business and the LBJ School of Public Affairs â€“ to discover new ways that advanced computing may be applied in these areas.</p>
