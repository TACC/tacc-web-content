			The Vislab will be closed for tours during the month of August. Touring availability begins the week of September 5th.</p>
		<p>
			Located on UT Austin's Main Campus in the POB Building, the Vislab is a showcase of the technologies that are used to support researchers as they turn their simulations into visually appealing, scientifically significant images. These tours are popular amongst K-12 and undergraduate students who engage hands-on with Lasso, a multi-touch screen, and Stallion, the world's highest resolution tiled wall.</p>
