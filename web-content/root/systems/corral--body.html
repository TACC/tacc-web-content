	The primary Corral storage resource is a set of six IBM Elastic Storage System arrays, providing approximately 40 petabytes of storage and capable of supporting over 5 billion files with a Spectrum Scale/GPFS file system. This resource is connected to the TACC core network and the wider internet at a speed of 100 Gigabits/second, and is accessible from any cluster system or Virtual Machine at TACC, as well as through a variety of specialized data access services such as iRODS, S3 and HTTPS. Secondary storage for disaster-recovery purposes is provided by an IBM LTFS tape library and a smaller front-end Elastic Storage System array, located in a separate datacenter operated by TACC.</p>

	Corral also provides a separate, fully encrypted storage area supporting TACCs secure data storage service. This service provides encryption-at-rest, secure data deletion, refined access controls and other data protection features necessary to comply with special legislation and/or commercial access restriction.</p>
