				The University of Texas at Austinâ€™s WeTeach_CS project trains K-12 educators to improve access to high quality CS experiences for a broad and diverse range of students. WeTeach_CS is increasing the number of CS certified high school teachers, increasing the number of high schools offering CS courses, increasing the number and diversity of students enrolled in CS courses, and expanding access to computational thinking, coding and programming experiences for all students in K-8.</p>

				In 2013-14, the year before The UT STEM Center initiated WeTeach_CS to improve Computer Science (CS) education, 67 total teachers were certified in Texas. In 2015-2016, 242 total teachers were certified - a <strong>261%</strong> increase. WeTeach_CS has supported <strong>488</strong> teachers in achieving their CS certification.</p>

				The percentage of high school students completing a CS course is maintaining steady growth but still represents <strong>less than 3% of the total high school population</strong>. Under-represented Minorities (URM) and Economically Disadvantaged (EcoDis) students are also seeing steady improvement, yet Female student enrollment is not matching overall student growth.</p>

		On December 15, 2017, The University of Texas at Austin announced that WeTeach_CS had received a $5 million grant from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to provide professional development to computer science teachers around the state and to help increase the number of certified CS teachers in Texas. Thirty-one WeTeach_CS Collaboratives were funded for 2018.</p>
	<h4>
		CS Professional Development Outreach</h4>
	<p>
		In 2017, WeTeach_CS provided 3,368 contact hours of training in computer science, computational thinking, coding, and programming to 1,010 Texas educators representing 640 schools and 283 districts (public, private, and charter).</p>
	<h4>
		CS Teacher Certification In Grades 8-12</h4>
	<p>
		488 in-service teachers have completed Computer Science Certification with support from WeTeach_CS, since Summer 2014.</p>
