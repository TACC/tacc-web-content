    <h4>
        Goals and Outcomes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Increase the number of certified Computer Science teachers in Texas</li>
        <li>
            Increase the number of high schools that offer Computer Science</li>
        <li>
            Increase the computer science content, pedagogical, and equity knowledge for PK-12 teachers.</li>
        <li>
            Create a strong community of Computer Science with PK-12 teachers, administrators, university faculty, and business / industry partners.</li>

    <h4>
        Activities and Benefits</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each Collaborative must serve a minimum of ten teachers. Each teacher must have a professional development plan to earn at least 60 hours of Computer Science training.</li>
        <li>
            Collaboratives must have a plan to offer at least 60 hours of Computer Science Professional Development. This can be a combination of online and face-to-face and may include WeTeach_CS statewide training and events such as the WeTeach_CS Summit, AP CS Principles Mini-Conference, or WeTeach_CS certification preparation (online of face-to-face workshops).</li>
        <li>
            A minimum of five teachers must actively pursue certification to teach Computer Science 8-12.</li>
        <li>
            Instructional teams for each Collaborative must includes a computer science professor.</li>
        <li>
            Collaborative teacher participants increase their content knowledge and pedagogical skills through research-based instruction and are provided opportunities to network with other computer science teachers from across the state.</li>
    </ul>
