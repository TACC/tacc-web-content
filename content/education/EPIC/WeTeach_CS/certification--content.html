    <p>
        Passing the Texas Education Agency's (TEA) Computer Science 8-12 Certification Test, Test Code 241 (CS 8-12 Test) is required to teach the following high school programming-based courses: Fundamentals of CS (can also be taught in Middle School), CS I, CS II and CS III. See the <a href="http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter126/ch126c.html" target="_blank">TEA's CS course detail</a> for more information on each course. This test is also recommended to teach the two Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science courses: <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/231724.html" target="_blank">AP Computer Science Principles</a> and <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/4483.html" target="_blank">AP Computer Science A</a>. Please note that while some resources are free, there are also approximately $180 in TEA registration and application fees for the test and certification. WeTeach_CS provides a limited number of $1000 stipends for teachers who become CS certified. It is essential that you apply for the CIP program before registering for the test to verify availability. The Register and Take Test section provides details.</p>
    <p>
        The CS 8-12 Test 241 covers four domains. (Scoring weight indicated below.)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Domain I – Technology Applications Core</b> (12.5%) – Understand how to use applications, data, networks, and the Internet to complete simple tasks and large projects.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Domain II – Program Design and Development</b> (35%) – Understand how to design and plan coding efforts.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Domain III – Programming Language Topics</b> (40%) – Write code using data, data types, arrays, loops, control structures, and data structures.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Domain IV – Specialized Topics</b> (12.5%) – This section covers advanced topics such as robotics, digital forensics, discrete math, and game design.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Prepare</h4>
    <p>
        If you have a standard or lifetime TEA teaching certificate and a bachelor's degree, you can earn a CS certification via the TEA's <a href="http://tea.texas.gov/interiorpage.aspx?id=25769812518" target="_blank">Certification By Exam</a> option, which involves passing the CS 8-12 Test. This path requires that you learn the CS content and related pedagogy on your own before taking the test. Test preparation is a significant amount of work. For most teachers, this effort will include one or two years of learning, practice and professional development. Note that if you don't have experience using computer applications, networks, and the Internet, we recommended that you pursue these types of experiences before taking on CS certification.</p>
    <p>
        There are many paths to prepare for the test. For example, if you have significant programming experience, you might be able to pass the test without preparing. Also, there are multiple content providers (Code.org, Code Academy, etc.) and languages (Java, Javascript, and Python) that you could choose, based on your preference. If you are looking for direction in this area, we outline one path that will prepare you for the test. Choose the button below to view and print a detailed checklist.</p>
