		Certification Incentive Program (CIP) Checklist</h3>
	<p>
		WeTeach_CS is offering a $1,000 stipend to currently certified Texas educators who add a CS certification to their resume. For complete information about deadlines and requirements, please read and follow all steps of the CIP Checklist below.</p>
	<h4>
		Don't Forget Certification Prep</h4>
	<p>
		If you're hoping to get CS certified and collect your $1000 stipend, then give yourself your best chance for success by getting prepared before you take the CS certification exam. To help you prepare, we've created a four-step <a href="/epic/weteachcs/certification/prep-checklist">Certification Prep Checklist</a>.</p>
	<h4>
		STEP 1: Verify CIP Eligibility</h4>
	<p>
		Candidates must meet all the following conditions to be eligible for the CIP stipend:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Be pursuing a TEA certification in Computer Science 8-12.</li>
		<li>
			Not already be certified in Computer Science or Computer Information Systems (any level).</li>
		<li>
			Be currently certified to teach in Texas or enrolled in an approved teacher certification program for Texas.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		STEP 2: Decide on When to Take the Test</h4>
	<p>
		The TExES CS 8-12 Test is available by appointment, year-round, on a first-come, first served basis. As you gain confidence in your programming skills, decide on a testing window when you plan on taking the test.</p>
	<h4>
		STEP 3: Understand CIP Requirements and Deadlines</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>You must complete the Certification Incentive Program (CIP) form online (link in Step 4)</b></li>
		<li>
			<b>You need to provide all of the subsequently requested documentation (listed in Step 5) before testing.</b></li>
		<li>
			After passing the CS 241 test, you will have five weeks to provide us with your updated SBEC Texas Educator Certificate.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		STEP 4: Complete CIP Application Form</h4>
	<p>
		Complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/V6X2eXUyzP1KvF6dA" target="_blank">CIP Application Form online</a>. Note that this form will ask you to specify your current teaching status and your Testing Window.</p>
	<h4>
		STEP 5: Deliver CIP Documentation</h4>
	<p>
		The documentation required for the CIP application follows. Please note we will not accept electronic signatures for this documentation. Collect PDFs or printouts of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			TEA Certification Information</li>
		<li>
			Completed and signed <a href="/documents/1084364/1761473/CIP-Assurances-Form.pdf/" target="_blank">Assurances Form</a></li>
		<li>
			Letter on official letterhead from your school administrator confirming your employment as a teacher or your enrollment in a teacher preparation program. (If you are currently certified, but not working for a school, this item is not required.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Submit the documentation using one of the following methods:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>PDFs:</b> Rename each PDF so that the filename includes your name. Create an email and attach the documents listed above. Send the email to <a href="mailto:CIP.x0zuckfks9gtkyft@u.box.com">CIP.x0zuckfks9gtkyft@u.box.com</a>. This email will send the documents to UT Box, a secure system that protects your personal information. There is no need to include text in the email since the system only accepts attachments.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Printouts:</b> If you prefer to work with printouts, you can send using mail or FedEx. Please keep a copy of the documentation. We are not responsible for forms lost or delayed in transit. Please see the Alternate delivery method for CIP documentation section at the bottom of this page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You will be notified by email upon acceptance to the program. If your decision to take the test is contingent on being accepted by the CIP Program, we suggest you wait to hear back from us before you register for the CS 8-12 Test.</p>
	<h4>
		STEP 6: Register for the CS 241 Test</h4>
	<p>
		Test appointments are available on a first-come, first served basis by appointment, year-round at several locations near you.</p>

	<h4>
		STEP 7: Take the Test</h4>
	<p>
		When you arrive at the CS 8-12 test day, we would like to say "Congratulations!" for what you have accomplished so far. Taking on a new teaching field takes significant commitment and determination. Taking on CS is challenging. We hope it will be even more rewarding. Good luck on the test!</p>
	<h4>
		STEP 8: Apply for the TEA Certification</h4>
	<p>
		After you receive your passing test score (Score Report Dates PDF), you may need to wait a few days for systems to update before logging in to TEA to request a certification update using these steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

		<li>
			Choose the "Apply for Certification" blue button.</li>
		<li>
			Complete the Applicant's Affidavit, then choose "Apply."</li>
		<li>
			Pay the appropriate fees and submit.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		STEP 9: Finalize the Stipend</h4>
	<p>
		<b>Almost there!</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Email a copy of your Teacher Certification Info now listing your Computer Science 8-12 certification to Nathalie Beausoleil at <a href="mailto:nathalie.b@tacc.utexas.edu">nathalie.b@tacc.utexas.edu</a>.</li>
		<li>
			After we receive your CS Certificate, you will be sent an electronic PIF to fill out which will require for you to attach your DL/Government ID.</li>
