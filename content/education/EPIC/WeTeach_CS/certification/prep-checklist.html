				This guide defines one path for 8-12 Cert Test preparation. Computer literacy (experience with applications, networks, and the Internet) is recommended before starting these steps. If you have programming experience, you will likely choose to do a subset of these steps, until you are comfortable programming in Java, Javascript or Python.</p>
