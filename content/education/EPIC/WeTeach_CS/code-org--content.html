	CS Fundamentals</h4>
<p>
	Computer science is foundational knowledge for all students in the 21st century. But a lot of schools don't teach it, especially at the elementary level. But now you can. With the help of <a href="http://code.org/" target="_blank">Code.org</a>, WeTeach_CS is providing a no-cost, one day workshop for K-5 teachers interested in teaching computer science. Over 80,000 teachers have participated in a workshop and the majority say it's the best PD they've ever attended. You will receive: In-person instruction including an intro to computer science, pedagogy, an overview of the online curriculum, teacher dashboard, and strategies for teaching "unplugged" classroom activities. In addition, you will receive: printed curriculum guide, certificate of completion, and fun Code.org swag. This session is designed for teachers, librarians, instructional coaches, and administrators grades K-5 to learn about Code.org resources and how to begin to integrate computer science into your future curriculum. This is a BYOD session, please bring your fully charged laptop, tablet or iPad and a power cord.</p>
