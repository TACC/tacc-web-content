# TACC Website Content - Web Content History

This directory mirrors the [Control Panel "Pages"][cp-pages] hierarchy. _If saved web content appears on page `news/conferences/sc/sc19`, then the saved repository file(s) is/are `./news/conferences/sc/sc19--[content].[ext]`\*._

## Rules

1. Any web content (that is to be version-controlled) **must** be saved in `content/`.
2. Any saved content **must** be saved in directory that mirrors the [Control Panel "Pages"][cp-pages] hierarchy.
3. Any saved content **should** use the naming format `[page]--[content].[ext]`\*.

\* Where `[page]` is the filename of the page for the web content, `[content]` is a lowercase description of the relevant web content, and `[ext]` is likely `.html` (if use cases for other extensions arise, then discuss with team).
