# TACC Website Content - Markup Templating - To Do List

## Architecture

1. Make exported file names be passed via build commands; ideas:
    - NPM `config` variable (that can be set on command line)
    - Create an NPM script for the `buildâ€¦` commands that takes arguments (via `commander`, `sywac`, or `arg`)
    - Add another dependency (to support cross-browser npm script arg passing)

## Documentation

1. Move `README.md` "Usage" section to Confluence as a basic intro to a template utility.
