<h4>
	ECEP (Expanding Computing Education Pathways)</h4>
<p>
	ECEP is a collective impact alliance of 22 states and the territory of Puerto Rico. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports ECEP through its Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance (BPC-A) program. The ECEP Alliance seeks to increase the number and diversity of students in the pipeline to computing and computing-intensive degrees by supporting state-level computing education reforms. Through interventions, pathways, partnerships and models that drive state-level computing education change, ECEP supports states as they work to align their state efforts with the national vision for computer science for all. The University of Texas at Austin serves as the backbone organizer for <a href="https://ecepalliance.org" target="_blank">ECEP</a>.</p>

<h4>
	AWSM in CS</h4>
<p>
	Accelerating Women's Success and Mastery in Computer Science (AWSM in CS) is an NSF funded Research Practitioner Partnership. AWSM in CS supports a Networked Improvement Community of 20+ secondary computing teachers all focused on increasing access and participation of young women in computing courses. This project seeks to apply the tools of improvement science to support teacher-led plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles that address this challenge and measure impact on females and particularly females of color.</p>

<h4>
	Project ROCS (Rural Opportunities in Computer Science)</h4>
<p>
	Project ROCS aims to produce a framework for collecting and reporting outcome measures that accurately portray the nature and extent of access to and participation in K-12 computer science education, especially for students in rural communities. This research project is funded by Google.</p>

<h4>
	Computer Science Regional Data</h4>
<p>
	The Computer Science Regional Data reports were created to help educational service centers (ESC's), school districts, and anyone interested in the progress of computer science education in Texas to better understand the data we have collected. You may download these pdf's to share/distribute.
