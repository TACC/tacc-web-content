                    WeTeach_CS educates, empowers, and inspires K-12 CS teachers, administrators, professional development providers, and university instructors to realize the vision of CSforALL. The STEM Center at The University of Texas at Austin serves as the backbone organization for the WeTeach_CS collective impact network which consists of numerous collaboratives serving hundreds of districts, schools, and educators in every region of Texas. WeTeach_CS is dedicated to broadening participation in computing for every Texas student regardless of race, gender, income, or location and leverages the STEM Center's extensive research and data collection expertise to guide strategic improvement in computing education at a state and national level. There are five main components to what we do:</p>

        Impact</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                In 2013-14, the year before The UT STEM Center initiated WeTeach_CS to improve Computer Science (CS) education, 67 total teachers were certified in Texas. In 2015-2016, 242 total teachers were certified - a <strong>261%</strong> increase. WeTeach_CS has supported <strong>488</strong> teachers in achieving their CS certification.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                Consequently, we have also seen a 78.7 % increase in the number of Texas high schools offering a CS course.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                The percentage of high school students completing a CS course is maintaining steady growth but still represents <strong>less than 3% of the total high school population</strong>. Under-represented Minorities (URM) and Economically Disadvantaged (EcoDis) students are also seeing steady improvement, yet Female student enrollment is not matching overall student growth.</p>

        On December 15, 2017, The University of Texas at Austin announced that WeTeach_CS had received a $5 million grant from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to provide professional development to computer science teachers around the state and to help increase the number of certified CS teachers in Texas. Thirty-one WeTeach_CS Collaboratives were funded for 2018.</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">
        CS Professional Development Outreach</h4>
    <p>
        In 2017, WeTeach_CS provided 3,368 contact hours of training in computer science, computational thinking, coding, and programming to 1,010 Texas educators representing 640 schools and 283 districts (public, private, and charter).</p>
    <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">
        CS Teacher Certification In Grades 8-12</h4>
    <p>
        488 in-service teachers have completed Computer Science Certification with support from WeTeach_CS, since Summer 2014.</p>
