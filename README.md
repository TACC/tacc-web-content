# TACC Website Content

This is a project to maintain revision history and collection of markup template utilities for Liferay Portal [Web Content][lr-web-content] in the TACC Website, but that are independent of the Liferay Portal infrastructure.

It was created Nov 2019 by Wesley B. so that the <abbr title="Communication Media & Design">CMD</abbr> team would be able to more easily perform, track, and review changes to the website but not require Liferay development knowledge.
