# TACC Website Content

This is a project to maintain revision history for web content and a collection of markup templating utilities for Liferay Portal [Web Content][lr-web-content] in the TACC Website, but that are independent of the Liferay Portal infrastructure.

It was created Nov 2019 by [Wesley B.][user-wb] so that the CMD (Communication Media & Design) team would be able to more easily perform, track, and review changes to the website but not require Liferay development knowledge.

The content for this `README.md` is broken into two sections, "Web Content History" and "Markup Templating".
